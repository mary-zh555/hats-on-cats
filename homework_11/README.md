## HW: Decorator

1. Create a program that allows you to search for images in gif format. The program should allow you to enter a search word. Using this word, search for GIFs using the Giphy API ([use their API](https://giphy.com/)). As a result, print the links to the GIFs.

2. Optional: Add the Telegram bot to the previous exercise. Ask the user to enter a search word in the Telegram interface and get a gif image as a result.
