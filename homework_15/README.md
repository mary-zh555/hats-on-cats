Create a data model for a AirBnb.com system. Your model should give ability to store information about the users, the rooms, the reservations, and the reviews. You should have two types of users: 

    1. Hosts
    2. Guests.

Host should be able to create rooms with different attributes (amount of residents, price, A/C, refrigerator, etc.)

Guest should be able to make a 

    1. Check availability of any rooms
    2. Make Reservation for a room.

For each table you should describe what is the primary key and what are the foreign keys (if any).

Result of the work might be description in a table. You can create tables in text file with description of each field. You also can you any graphic tool that you might use to create data model. I usually use DRAW.io for such thing, but might choose another tool.

(Optional): Add this possibilities for a guest

    1. Pay for reservation
    2. Review for the host.
