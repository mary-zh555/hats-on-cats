# Homework Repository

This repository serves as a collection of my homework tasks for the Projector Institute Python course. As of now, it contains homework assignments starting from the 8th task. Please note that I will be continuously updating the repository with new tasks as I progress through the course.

## Description
The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase my solutions to various programming assignments and challenges assigned during the Python course at Projector Institute. Each homework task will be stored in a separate folder, labeled according to the homework number.

## Homework Contents
The repository will be organized as follows:

Homework 8: Description of the task and my solution code (pending).
Homework 9: Description of the task and my solution code (pending).
...

As the course progresses, I will add new folders for each new homework task I complete.

## How to Use
To explore the solutions for each homework task, you can navigate to the corresponding folder in this repository. Inside each folder, there will be a README file with a description of the task, along with the source code files containing my solutions.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/mary-zh555/projector-institute-python-course.git

Feel free to review the code and the solutions I have implemented. If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, I am open to discussions and improvements.

These solutions are my own work and are meant to serve as references for the course assignments. Please do not copy or submit them as your own work.
